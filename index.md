# Welcome to My GitHub Page

Welcome to my blog! This site was created using Jekyll, Markdown, and GitHub Pages, inspired by the All In Africa (All In Access) Open Source program.

## About the Program

All In Africa is an online educational program that provides Africans with free open-source education, comprehensive training, mentorship, vibrant community engagement and involvement, and career-focused experiential opportunities. The program aims to empower Africans by equipping them with the skills and knowledge needed to contribute to and thrive in the open-source community. All In Africa is designed to bridge the diversity gap among developers on the continent.

I am proud to be an alumnus of the recently concluded Cohort 2. During this program, I learned about GitHub Pages, which I used to create this blog site and will use for future posts.

## Features

- **Powered by Jekyll**: A simple, blog-aware, static site generator.
- **Markdown**: Easy-to-write and format text.
- **Hosted on GitHub Pages**: Seamless integration with GitHub for hosting.

## About Me

I am an Android Developer with a passion for learning and exploring the world of open source. As an enthusiastic open-source contributor, I advocate for continuous learning and community involvement. This blog is a platform where I share my journey, experiences, and insights gained from the All In Africa program and beyond.
